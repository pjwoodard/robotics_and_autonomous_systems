This directory is used to generate the VHD ROM file for the Picoblaze Project.  Write the software using the picoblaze assembly language in the lab6_starter.psm file.  Then once ready to test, run the kcpsm6.exe and enter the file to process, which in this case is lab6_starter.psm.  Assuming no errors in the assemlbly the tool will generate the lab6_starter.vhd file which can be imported into the Xilinx Picoblaze project to generate a new bitfile with the new software.

DO NOT Modify the Xilinx Vivado Project except to add in the generated lab6_starter.vhd that is generated by the KCPSM6 Assembler.  There is no need to modify VHDL for this project!
